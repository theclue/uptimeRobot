\description{
\code{uptimerobot.monitor.new} creates a new monitor with the given properties.
}
\details{
The function returns the ID of the newly created monitor in case success. An error is thrown otherwise.

The alert contacts are whom to be notified when the monitor goes up/down.

Multiple alert contact IDs can be sent in a character vector or in a data frame. If you pass alert contact IDs in a vector, each element must be formatted in the form \code{<id>_<threshold>_<recurrence>} (note the underscores).
If you prefer to format it as a data.frame, it must have these three columns: \code{id, threshold, recurrence}, numeric or integer. Order of the columns doesn't matter.

Please note that thresholds and recurrences can be omitted (default to zero) and, as they are only available in the Pro Plan, they are always 0 in the Free Plan.
